To build, open a terminal with NodeJS and NPM installed and run "npm install" 
in this directory.  On success, a "dist" subdirectory will be created containing
"index.html", which can be opened in a browser to start the game.

To rebuild automatically as changes are made, run "npm run-script watch" 
instead.
